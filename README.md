# imageProcessing

We are surrounded with Images so we should be able to manipulate them extract features and gain meaningful insights from them.

This is an image processing Mini project where in we take an image and apply the existing image enhancement, manipulation techniques, to name a few like morphology, segmentation,
sharpening, smoothing etc.
